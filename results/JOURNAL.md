# Optimization Journal

Append-only log of the optimization loop: one entry per experiment run —
hypothesis, result vs. best, what was learned. Failed hypotheses are
information; record them.

Format:

```
## NNN_short_name @ stageX — YYYY-MM-DD
- hypothesis: ...
- result: wMAPE X.XXXX (best was X.XXXX) — improved/no change/worse
- learned: ...
```

## 000_seasonal_naive @ stage1 — 2026-08-06
- hypothesis: none — floor baseline (repeat last observed same weekday).
- result: wMAPE 0.2938 (first entry). Lead 1–7: 0.2714, lead 8–14: 0.3164.
  61/105 series active in 2023. Rerun reproduced 0.293827 exactly
  (determinism contract verified).
- learned: customer series (0.3226) are much harder than tail groups
  (0.2294) — aggregation smooths noise. Network-level wMAPE 0.1783 means
  most series-level error is idiosyncratic and cancels in the sum.

## 001_weekday_profile @ stage1 — 2026-08-06
- hypothesis: mean of last 4 same-weekday observations beats naive by
  smoothing one-off spikes.
- result: wMAPE 0.2654 vs 0.2938 — improved 9.7% relative. Current best.
- learned: smoothing helps everywhere (customers 0.2986, tail 0.1909), at
  the cost of slight under-forecast (bias −1.4%) — it lags the 2023 growth
  trend. Obvious next hypotheses: trend correction on the 4-week window,
  holiday calendar features, and November-peak handling.
